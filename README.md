# Toxic comment classification
- The dataset is from Wikipedia comments and they got labeled by human. 
- There are six types of toxicity [toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate]
- The aim is to classify the comments and since the problem is a multilabel one comments can belong to multiple classes.
- For the training I used a pretrained XLNET model.
- After training, result got submitted to kaggle (98.2% accuracy)
